If you still don&#8217;t know ( which is good actually) there has been a lot of talk about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the front end divide (opens in a new tab)" href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/" target="_blank">the front end divide</a> I call it. About the huge difference between developers who call themselves front end developer but have nothing in common. Eventually though in my opinion it is all about **the User Interface.** We should stop fighting around it.

## User Interface as the goal

As a front end developer we may have very different workflows. Generally we use various tools. Frameworks, bundlers, editors, servers and all that. We all have our own choices and preferences.<figure class="wp-block-image">

But at the very end we create User Interfaces for the web. Web in general. We give life to our code. We build stuff and produce beautiful websites and applications: **We make the web.**

### The core of User Interface

From the very beginning web has bee built on top of three major things. Which I would like to call them the core of User Interface.<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">

<img src="http://www.nikpro.com.auhtml-core.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-32684" width="708" height="355" srcset="http://testgatsby.localhtml-core.jpg 670w, http://testgatsby.localhtml-core-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /> <figcaption>HTML the core</figcaption></figure>

WE know them. **HTML, CSS and Javascript**. **Some say HTML is the ver core which is right**. It is the Structure and without it there is no web.

**CSS** is there to **design it.** To make differences and **style** the core. And that is what makes CSS really hard.

But no one can also ignore the importance of Javascript. It is what lives in the browser to **give motion life** to the User Interface. To **make it function** so to speak.<figure class="wp-block-image">

## The tech behind the scenes

The fight is pretty much between UX engineers and Javascript engineers. But it is a non necessary fight.

If we understand the core, there is no debate. All the work is towards the same purpose but with different paths.

### UX Enginners

They are basically CSS masters which live most of their life inside the browser. Making pretty designs. Therefore they use design pattens , write lots of HTML and CSS and a bit of Javascript.<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">

<img src="http://www.nikpro.com.aujs-core.png" alt="" class="wp-image-32682" width="697" height="418" srcset="http://testgatsby.localjs-core.png 500w, http://testgatsby.localjs-core-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /> <figcaption>Javascript the function</figcaption></figure>

### Javascript Engineers

They are very skilled Javascript developers.They do pretty much everything in JS. They write HTML and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="recently most CSS (opens in a new tab)" href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/168-css-in-js/" target="_blank">recently most CSS</a> in jS. Therefore they mostly use JS frameworks like [React and Angular](http://www.nikpro.com.au/react-or-angular-how-much-it-matters/) and Vue and Ember and other JS frameworks to create User Interfaces.

## The Great Divide

The fight is about which one is real front end developer. CSS guys or JS guys. Basically I made it very simple to understand. Both. Because it is not about tools and skills and how you make the web.

It is all about the User Interface. We all make websites and applications and we all do it in our own ways. And as long as we respect the real core which is **HTML** in terms of accessibility and semantics, it doesn&#8217;t matter what our title is. The core should be cherished and cared of. And we all are in the same boat making an amazing web for everyone.

Thank you for reading.
