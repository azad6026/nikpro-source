It is correct that you should plan ahead to achieve success. It applies to anything you are thinking of learning of doing. [Learning](http://www.nikpro.com.au/no-matter-what-happens-never-stop-learning/) for sure should be part of a daily schedule and should [never be stopped](http://www.nikpro.com.au/no-matter-what-happens-never-stop-learning/). Planing ahead is essential and hard. To be able to plan your time, you need to know about the big goal first.

### The Goal

The big goal does not necessarily be an ambitious one.It could be building a new app with your preferred programming language or it could be reviewing how you built your last project and make amends or build a similar project.Or if you are really ambitious, it could be how to master React or how to become a content writer. 

Depends on the size of the goal, the steps to make the plan varies. But the concept remains the same. You need to break down all the steps that has to be taken. They need to be categorised to big and small steps.

### An Example

For example, to learn a new language, you need to find resources, think of a basic project you can start with as big steps. Then, you will break down each step. You will look for the best and most effective resources that you could find in different kinds. Videos, books, tutorials, projects. If you could find a sample project and luckily a course that could teach you through steps of how to build the project, you could setup a good training timetable for yourself. 

### Passion and commitment

To be able to actually learn something and gain knowledge, you need o be committed to have a fixed time every day to learn and practice until you finish it. It needs lots of commitment and perseverance and sticking to the plan but it pays off at the end if you continue the hard work and if you really really want to do it and are passionate about what you want to achieve.
