I was looking through some articles around [SEO](http://www.nikpro.com.au/digital-marketing-content-writing-or-just-blogging/) to see how SEO works and how keywords matter. Keywords can be described as the topic for your content. They are also the words or phrases people type into search engines. Placement and density are the two key factors to know about here. So where to use your keywords will effect the SEO rank of your post. And also density is how many times you have used that keyword.

## Keywords

In 2018, with google changing its algorithm for ranking pages every now and then, the density does not mater it seems.Simply put, Google’s search algorithm is more advanced than counting the amount of keyword matches on a page. They’re more advanced than assessing keyword density as well. Also the keywords themselves. What matters is the content and how you used the keywords to have a more descriptive article.

**A simple tip to Remember:** the closer to the beginning of the title and URL the keywords are placed, the better. You should also have your keywords in the first paragraph on the page, provided it sounds natural.

## **So should we completely ignore keywords?**

Of course not. All of these advices are legitimate. The problem is that it just isn’t that simple. The first point to make is that if your content is user centric, your keyword (and related phrases) will more than likely occur naturally.

If your content is too weird and wonderful, it can have a negative impact on your ability to attract the appropriate traffic due to the fact that it is simply too complex for Google to understand which search terms to rank your website for.

This balancing act can take time and experience. You don’t want to include keywords for the sake of it, but you don’t want to make Google’s life overly hard. Experiment, analyse, iterate.

Having a top rank site is harder than it seems and it needs lots of SEO practices to be put into account. It also requires good hands on writing.

We need to be patient and practice as much as possible and keep our SEO knowledge updated.
