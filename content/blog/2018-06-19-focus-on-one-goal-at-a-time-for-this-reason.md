Let me explain why we should focus on one goal at a time. There are lots of goals in my mind that I need to achieve. I would love to learn and utilise new programming skills like React and Python, also I wish to have a fixed session of sports on a daily basis and I want to read books an hour a day. The list will go on if I think about it and I am sure you have a long list too. But we should focus on one goal at a time only.

## The Reason

We probably have seen people who are trying to do lots of things at the same timeÂ  or we might have experienced it ourselves and we have seen failure at the end. It makes sense actually.

Based on lots of researches and studies it has been proven that we cannot do or complete more that one task or goal at a time if we really mean to be successful in it. The study has shown that also for that one goal that you might gain success in if you focus, you need o have a repeated practice in a certain time an place on a daily basis. It means you need to be committed to the gaol.

Let me explain it better. The study was based on people who were asked to mention for example tomorrow at what time, where and how they want to do a certain tasks (like swimming for example). Those who filled out the form about this question and were doing the task at the time and place they have promised about were 2 to 3 times more successful to actually gain that skill. Meaning to gain a skill or to make it as a new habit in your need to commit yourself in doing it in certain time and place and have a [plan for it](http://www.nikpro.com.au/plan-ahead-to-achieve-success/).

## Remember This

**BUT this is not the whole thing. The study has shown that you can do this only if you focus on one goal at a time. Also it has shown that it takes around 60 days for a habit with this plan to get set in our life style.**

This is very essential to remember that our mind has been set to focus on one goal to be a daily habit if we have a plan for it. So if we want to learn lots of skills it is not possible to do it at the same time. We need to do it one by one and be committed to our plan and only after a few months which is most likely 2 month, we could be certain that we have set a new skill or habit on or daily life. It takes time, commitment and effort to gain new skills but we must remember to focus only on one goal at a time.
