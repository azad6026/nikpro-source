That is right.Â No matter what happens Never stop learning. It doesn&#8217;t matter how hard it might look or no matter what happens. Just never stop learning and [pushing yourself forward](https://www.nikpro.com.au/frustration-and-tiredness-is-your-enemy-to-improve-your-skills-and-grow/). Learning is the crucial key to always feel happy and on the board.

### Why We Stop

There are some times in our busy life that we forget about the importance of gaining new skills at all times. It seems when we do a project or a task, we feel that just doing and completing that project is enough to improve our knowledge around that software or language. Although we might need to research about what we code about and we have to try and retry coding and face lots of challenges, but the learning stage should not be stopped.

### How To Do It

Each and every day, there need to be a training time scheduled and the brain should be ready to learn whatever has been prepared for it. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be a practical session. It could be reading articles from various resources, researching about any topic, investigating around a new framework or language, reviewing the fundamentals of a core language, practicing with a new coding environment or tool or simply learning a new topic on a familiar framework.

### TimeFrame

The length of the learning session could be just half an our or more if possible bu the most important thing is the effectiveness of it alongside the projects. Specifying a specific time of the day to this task is as equally important as doing it altogether.

No matter how much we do learn every day or how good we do it, we must not stop it. Never for any reason stop learning. Not just around coding environment or work projects but about any practical and useful and life changing and challenging thing that possible. No matter what happens, Never stop learning.
