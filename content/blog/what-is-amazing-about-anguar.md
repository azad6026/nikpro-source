## What is amazing about [Angular](http://www.nikpro.com.au/react-or-angular-how-much-it-matters/)?

I would like to share my opinion about what is so amazing and interesting about <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a>. AlthoughI haven&#8217;t built anything serious with angular just yet, but I could explain why it has always been my favourite front end framework to have an eye on.

## A google product

That is right. I do care about who build a software or pretty much anything. Angular is developed by google which means it has a huge support and community. Google makes awesome products in any range and when it comes to software, it is incredible. You can rely on them for maintainability and lifetime support. ( I know that in Angular case, especially Angular 2-6 ,there has been a few issues around version control, but that happens on big software scales).

## Fantastic Documentation

In this case, they are unbeatable. The documentation of Angular is fantastic and very easy to use. Everything is in its place and you enjoy the flow of content throughout the kickstarters and tutorials. You just don&#8217;t need to goole things as all you need to start with is in one place. A modern approach for documentation that one enjoys going through and start learning.

## Template ( The View)

This is what I adore and love the most. The semantic view part of Angular applications. You write your code the way you speak about it. You know each what angular tag does and is for after a while. Super clean and clear HTML that you love to look at.A fully seperate template from the logic. Great.

## The Framework Structure

It is just right and perfect. Although learning the structure and knowing how things work takes some time, but the seperation of Model and Controller and View is easy and clear. If we follow the structure while building the application all along, everything will take place the way they should.

## Typescript

This is the winner section of Angular.  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/angular.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Typescript</a> is a very beautiful  typed superset of ES6 Javascript  that compiles to plain Javascript and Angular is based on that. It is written nicely and if one get used to it, they could utilise the power of Typescript in their applications. 

## CLI

And who will forget about <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI</a> (command line interface) for Angular that makes everything super easy. Using CLI, you just type a few commands and it builds your application for you based on your structure. 

## Dependencies

And a very important aspect of Angular is that you have almost everything you need inside the framework. You don&#8217;t need third party libraries and dependencies. Everything is bundled in Angular framework and you just need to call it to be able to use it. It is amazing and very handy and saves a lot of time down the track.

Based on all these features and a lot more that I didn&#8217;t mention, Angular is very popular and admirable and makes development full of joys and fo course challenges which is what is amazing about Angular.
