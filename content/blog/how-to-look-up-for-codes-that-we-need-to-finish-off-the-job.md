There are hundreds of ways to look up codes that is needed to finish a project or to simply go to the next stage. Sometimes we <a href="https://www.nikpro.com.au/wordpress-difficulties-and-challenges-how-to-face-wordpress-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get stuck</a> and it seems to take ages to write the right code on our own if we are lucky enough to know &#8220;how&#8221; to write it.

But the truth is we don&#8217;t know everything and we are not supposed to know. No one knows every part of a coding language because it is not necessary. You need to know the basics and then build up on those fundamentals and look for snippets or hints that you need to learn and complete or continue your jobs or projects.

What I would do is search and search and research if needed. I would google it with clear &#8220;how to&#8221; statement and scan whatever available in the search results and open up the closest ones. Sometimes the most popular sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow</a> give you the very piece of code or hint but that is not the story all the time.

There are times that I need to investigate about the specifics of my question. Even w3schools has easy and good examples that might turn on the light in my head. Investigation continues if I couldn&#8217;t find what I need from the first search results.

Another great site that I like to mention is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mozilla dev</a> site that explains everything very clear and precise that one might find what they are looking for. I have used it a lot and its information is reliable and accurate I believe.

There are other ways other than just searching that could help. Reading other peoples or example codes is a wonderful and amazing way to learn and find around the area that we need to finish our code. <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codepen</a> or <a href="https://jsfiddle.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSfiddle</a> are really helpful and have lots of examples and sample codes. I love codepen and of course my favourite site <a href="https://css-tricks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">css tricks</a> which its owner Chris Coyer built codepen as well.

I love this searching and researching journey and what I so is to put together all bits and pieces of code I can find and make my very own version out of them. Once I read a good coder copies codes but a great one steals them. So how do you look up your code needs to complete your projects?
